Project that analyzes various research questions regarding salaries for big tech companies across the United States.

Research Questions associated with the project:

2. What are the highest paying (and lowest paying) Big Tech companies to work for in the United States?

Additional Questions answered in this project:

3. Which States pay the highest/lowest wages?

4. Can a model be fit to predict wages based on company, years of total experience, and years at current company?

**TLDR:**

Which Big Tech Jobs Pay the Most?
- Looking at only the United States, the highest paying Big Tech Jobs are management positions. As far as mid-level positions, the highest paying roles are engineers, architects (data, solutions, etc.), and sales. When compared to Europe, many of the same trends follow.

Which Big Tech Companies Pay the Most (and the Least)?
- Overall, the average salary is the highest for DoorDash (when only looking at well known companies). However, when only looking at select companies and roles, Netflix pays the most on average across the board. In constrast, when looking at these select roles, Microsoft pays the least on average.

Which States Have the Highest (and Lowest) Big Tech Salaries?
- When looking at the choropleth map, the highest paying states on average for Big Tech companies are California, New York, Washington, Hawaii, and Massechussets. While the lowest paying states are mainly located in the Midwest.

Can a Model be Fit to Predict Salaries Based on a Few Different Factors?
- Since the model only accounts for around 36% of the variation in salary, we can not conclude that our model is able to predict salaries based on the given factors.

The findings from this analysis could be used for potential job seekers for where they should live, what roles they could seek out, and which companies they should choose to apply to.
